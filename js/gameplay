TYPEFIGHTER SINGLEPLAYER GAMEPLAY IDEAS

write as many words as you can in 30/60 seconds.

score is saved and a combo plays with the number of words completed ending with your chosen finishing move (shoryuken / metsu-hadoken / raging demon)

TO IMPLEMENT THIS:

MODULIZE CODE:
Akuma anims / functions

add start button (with a 3 2 1 fight countdown)
add gameplay timer

add combo tracker
add combo function

create anims for all attacks, put each in a function
add all attacks to an array
call a random attack for each hit in the combo

add finishing moves and append them to the end of the combo

POLISH:
tighten anims, add sounds
