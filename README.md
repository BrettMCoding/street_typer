A small JS / HTML5 Phaser3 typing game

Coded in about a month, I made this as my first foray into coding after the "Do a bunch of tutorials and practice problems" stage of learning. The goalposts shifted and morphed as I went along and found so many cool ways to use the Phaser 3 framework.

The code as it stands is still a mess, but it runs. akuma.js is the first instance of class extension I've done. In it, you can see I added a child property that holds the akuma sprite.

Towards the end of the project, were anakaris.js and skeletonmedium.js. These are much cleaner. With the sprite, emitters and more tied to the class itself, as I learned more about class extension and OOP in general, as well as researching other Phaser3 based games that implemented code like this.

The sprites were mostly from spritedatabase. I animated, pivot-adjusted and packed them with TexturePacker. If the assets weren't ripped, I designed them myself (The buttons, the super combo tier-word).

The sounds are from various games I've loved throughout the years. Can you name them all? :D
